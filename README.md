- 👋 Hi, I’m @Livkei
- 👀 Now I'm a clinical medical student.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use R language to do some wonderful statistic analysis of RNA seq???
- 💞️ Because I'm still learning in school, I'll keep on learning new things and doing a little practise.
- 📫 This is my mail used usually, Kicloud66@outlook.com
